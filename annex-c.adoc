dBASE .DBF File Structure

Technical Information Database

This document has been annotated to reflect the conventions established by the CDB standard.  Collectively, these conventions are referred to as dBASE/CDB.  The conventions define how dBASE files are interpreted by a CDB-compliant dBASE reader; the stated conventions supersede or replace related aspects of this annotated specification.  Unless stated otherwise, CDB-compliant dBASE readers will ignore any data that fails to conform to the stated conventions.

Note on directory and file names: Shape/CDB Readers: The CDB standard globally provides a set of directory and filename conventions.  The conventions do not limit filenames to the 8.3 naming convention

TI838D.txt   dBASE .DBF File Structure

Category   :Database Programming

Platform    :All

Product    :Delphi  All

Description:

Sometimes it is necessary to delve into a dBASE table outside the control of the Borland Database Engine (BDE). For instance, if the .DBT file (that contains memo data) for a given table is irretrievably lost, the file will not be usable because the byte in the file header indicates that there should be a corresponding memo file. This necessitates toggling this byte to indicate no such accompanying memo file. Or, you may just want to write your own data access routine.

Below are the file structures for dBASE table files. Represented are the file structures as used for various versions of dBASE: dBASE III PLUS 1.1, dBASE IV 2.0, dBASE 5.0 for DOS, and dBASE 5.0 for Windows.

* The data file header structure for dBASE III PLUS table file.*

************************************************************************

[underline]#*The table file header:#*



[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=================================================================================================================================================================================
|*Byte* |*Contents* |*Description*
|0 |1 Byte |Valid dBASE III PLUS table file (03h without a memo (.DBT file; 83h with a memo).
|1-3 |3 Bytes |Date of last update; in YYMMDD format
|4-7 |32 bit number |Number of records in the table
|8-9 |16 bit number |Number of bytes in the header
|10-11 |16 bit number |Number of bytes in the record
|12-14 |3 Bytes |Reserved Bytes
|15-27 |13 Bytes |Reserved for dBASE III PLUS on a LAN
|28-31 |4 Bytes |Reserved bytes
|32-n |32 Bytes each |Field descriptor array (the structure of this array is shown below).
|N+1 |1 Byte |0Dh stored as the field terminator. n above is the last byte in the field descriptor array. The size of the array depends on the number of fields in the table file.
|=================================================================================================================================================================================

*Table Field Descriptor Bytes*

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|==================================================================================
|*Byte* |*Contents* |*Description*
|0-10 |11 Bytes |Field name in ASCII (zero-filled).
|11 |1 Byte |Field type in ASCII (C, D, L, M, or N).
|12-15 |4 Bytes |Field data address (address is set in memory; not useful on disk).
|16 |1 Byte |Field length in binary
|17 |1 byte |Field decimal count in binary
|18-19 |2 Bytes |Reserved for dBASE III PLUS on a LAN
|20 |1 Byte |Work area ID
|21-22 |2 Bytes |Reserved for dBASE III PLUS on a LAN
|23 |1 Byte |SET FIELDS flag
|24 |1 Byte |Reserved bytes
|==================================================================================

[underline]#*Table Records#*



The records follow the header in the table file. Data records are preceded by one byte, that is, a space (20h) if the record is not deleted, an asterisk (2Ah) if the record is deleted. Fields are packed into records without field separators or record terminators. The end of the file is mark by a single byte, with the end-of-file marker, an OEM code page character value of 26 (1Ah). You can input OEM code page data as indicated below.

[underline]#*Allowable Input for dBASE Data Types#*


[cols=",",options="header",]
|============================================================================================================================
|*Data Type* |*Data Input*
|C (Character)   |All OEM code page characters
|D (Date)        |Numbers and a character to separate month, day, and year (stored internally as 8 digits in YYYYMMDD format)
|N (Numeric)     |0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
|L (Logical)     |? Y y N n T t F f (? when not initialized).
|M (Memo)        |All OEM code page characters (stored internally as 10 digits representing a .DBT block number).
| |
|============================================================================================================================

[underline]#Binary, Memo, and OLE Fields And .DBT Files#



Memo fields store data in .DBT files consisting of blocks numbered sequentially (0, 1, 2, and so on). The size of these blocks are internally set to 512 bytes. The first block in the .DBT file, block 0, is the .DBTfile header.

Memo field of each record in the .DBF file contains the number of the block (in OEM code page values) where the field's data actually begins. If a field contains no data, the .DBF file contains blanks (20h) rather than a number.

When data is changed in a field, the block numbers may also change and the number in the .DBF may be changed to reflect the new location.

This information is from the Using dBASE III PLUS manual, Appendix C.

[underline]#*Memo Fields And .DBT Files#*



Memo fields store data in .DBT files consisting of blocks numbered sequentially (0, 1, 2, and so on). SET BLOCKSIZE determines the size of each block. The first block in the .DBT file, block 0, is the .DBT file header.

Each memo field of each record in the .DBF file contains the number of the block (in OEM code page values) where the field's data actually begins. If a field contains no data, the .DBF file contains blanks (20h) rather than a number.

When data is changed in a field, the block numbers may also change and the number in the .DBF may be changed to reflect the new location.

*Memo Fields And .DBT Files*



Memo fields store data in .DBT files consisting of blocks numbered sequentially (0, 1, 2, and so on). SET BLOCKSIZE determines the size of each block. The first block in the .DBT file, block 0, is the .DBT file header.

Each memo field of each record in the .DBF file contains the number of the block (in OEM code page values) where the field's data actually begins. If a field contains no data, the .DBF file contains blanks (20h) rather than a number.

When data is changed in a field, the block numbers may also change and the number in the .DBF may be changed to reflect the new location.

Unlike dBASE III PLUS, if you delete text in a memo field, dBASE 5.0 for DOS may reuse the space from the deleted text when you input new text. dBASE III PLUS always appends new text to the end of the .DBT file. In dBASE III PLUS, the .DBT file size grows whenever new text is added, even if other text in the file is deleted.

The records follow the header in the table file. Data records are preceded by one byte, that is, a space (20h) if the record is not deleted, an asterisk (2Ah) if the record is deleted. Fields are packed into records without field separators or record terminators.

|====================


*Binary, Memo, and OLE Fields And .DBT Files*



Binary, memo, and OLE fields store data in .DBT files consisting of blocks numbered sequentially (0, 1, 2, and so on). SET BLOCKSIZE determines the size of each block. The first block in the .DBT file, block 0, is the .DBT file header.

Each binary, memo, or OLE field of each record in the .DBF file contains the number of the block (in OEM code page values) where the field's data actually begins. If a field contains no data, the .DBF file contains blanks (20h) rather than a number.

When data is changed in a field, the block numbers may also change and the number in the .DBF may be changed to reflect the new location.

Unlike dBASE III PLUS, if you delete text in a memo field (or binary and OLE fields), dBASE for Windows (unlike dBASE IV) may reuse the space from the deleted text when you input new text. dBASE III PLUS always appends new text to the end of the .DBT file. In dBASE III PLUS, the .DBT file size grows whenever new text is added, even if other text in the file is deleted.

This information is from the dBASE for Windows Language Reference manual, Appendix C.
