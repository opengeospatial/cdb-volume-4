All instances of the feature _SHALL_ be of the same Shape type. While the Shapefile format supports up to 13 different types (each one stored in a different shape file), the CDB standard requires a maximum of one Shapefile type for point features, a maximum of one Shapefile type for lineal features and a maximum of one Shapefile type for polygon features for each tile (for a maximum of 3 feature Shapefiles per tile). {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
